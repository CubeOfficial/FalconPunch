# Building FalconPunch

Okay so first, you need to install [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php)

After you did that get a good text editor, i reccomend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 

*WARNING!! YOU MUST DELETE THE OLD BIN FOLDER OR ELSE!!!!!* 

Then run the Build.bat

*side note: if the game won't run, run cmd into the root project and type *build.bat*
