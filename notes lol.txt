Due to the building process i don't even know if this will go open sourced.

I never really tested the game outside of my pc so i don't even know if the game will run properly.

The person can try to but i think they'll need SFML installed (of course) to build the game. 

I also think the player should have a good text editor or IDE (Integrated development environment). 

I recommend Visual Studio code, but the player  can do what they want with this code.

If the player knows what their supposed to do i don't see a issue here, i see a bright future of this game.

The code name for this project was called *POG* because the game is pog. I thought it be funny to name this game something nobody would expect.

Well don't waste your time reading this, you wanted to build the game lol. Go ahead im not gonna stop you.

I just wanna thank PG350 for making this game what it is today, if he didn't show me a small snippet of a prototype he did, this game wouldn't exist.
